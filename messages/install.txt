SmarterLineMoves
================

A Sublime Text package that allows to move your text lines in a smarter way.

Comes with the following features:

* SmartSwap: Always keep a few lines of space between your moving text and the
  text window's edges.
* Swap Above/Below: Allows to keep the text moving, even after it hits the top
  or bottom of the text window.
* Push Up/Down: text
* Repel/Attract: TODO


+ Shortcuts for jump to definition have changed:

  For Mac OS X:
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Click``
    * Jump to definition = ``Control+Command+Alt+Up``
    * Go back = ``Control+Command+Alt+Left``
    * Manual CodeIntel = ``Control+Shift+space``
